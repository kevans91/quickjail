.Dt QUICKJAIL 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm quickjail ,
.Nm quickshell
.Nd Utility to spawn transient single-command jails
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Oo Fl c Oc
.Oo param Ns = Ns Ar value ... Oc
.Ar command Ns = Ns Ar command ...
.Nm quickshell
.Oo Fl s Oc
.Ar path
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to create transient single-command jails in a reasonably secure
manner.
.Pp
The key advantage to
.Nm
over
.Xr jail 8
is the model that
.Nm
uses to execute
.Ar command .
.Nm
will fork and execute
.Ar command
in a non-persistent jail, while
.Xr jail 8
will mark the jail as persistent and remove the jail when the child process is
gone.
For some use-cases, this behavior is not ideal as it may potentially leave the
jail behind depending on how the child command exits.
.Pp
If a
.Ar path
param is specified to
.Nm ,
then
.Nm
will
.Xr chdir 2
to this path before creating the jail with the same
.Ar path .
.Pp
An optional flag,
.Fl c ,
is allowed if specified before any other parameters.
The
.Fl c
flag is otherwise ignored.
This allows
.Nm
to maintain an interface compatible with
.Xr jail 8
for the purposes of other tools, like
.Xr bectl 8 .
.Pp
The
.Nm quickshell
command is a simplified interface to
.Nm
specifically for running a shell in the alien
.Ar path .
It defaults to
.Xr sh 1 ,
but that may be overridden by the
.Ev QUICKSHELL
environment variable.
.Pp
If the
.Fl s
argument is supplied to
.Nm quickshell ,
then it will use the
.Ev SHELL
environment variable instead of
.Ev QUICKSHELL .
.Pp
.Nm quickshell
explicitly does not use the user's current shell because it is assumed that the
.Ar path
we are creating a jail at does not have the user's current shell.
This is the common case for the author of
.Nm quickshell .
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Nm
.Ar path=/mnt
.Ar command=/bin/sh
.Pp
.Nm
.Ar name=qemu0
.Ar path=/mnt
.Ar command=/bin/sh
.Pp
.Nm quickshell
.Ar /mnt
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr jail 8
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
was a quick-and-dirty hack to facilitate the author's testing of qemu usermode
emulation.
